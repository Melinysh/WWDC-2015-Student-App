### WWDC 2015 Student App Submission

This is my app submission for a [WWDC Student Scholarship](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/).  

#### Update:
I have been awarded a scholarship! I'm looking forward to returning to WWDC this year.   

#### Update 2:
Another great year at WWDC! I learned so much and met many talented people. I've made minor changes to the project so it is compatible with iOS 9 and the latest Swift syntax, but the core of the app is the exact same as the one I submitted in April.

You can read about the development of this app and my time at WWDC in this [blog post](http://melinysh.me/wwdc,/apple,/swift/2015/07/27/wwdc-2015-experience.html).
